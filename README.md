# Jekyll CSV-to-timeline plugin

Docs to come, but I need to actually *use* it somewhere at the moment.

Just up and standing on its frail legs. Examples etc. coming shortly...

## Notes

To get the CSV of a Google Doc:

```sh
curl 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<yourkey>/export?exportFormat=csv'
```
